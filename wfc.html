                    <h2>So What is the Wave Function Collapse algorithm?</h2>
                    <p>The wave function collapse algorithm is computer code that is used to procedurally
                        generate textures (such as a brick wall, forest, or building) and 3D models. One common use for this code is to create the backgrounds you see
                        in computer games.
                    </p>
                    <p>There are two types of wave function collapse:  the tile model and the overlapping model.  This is an 
                        implemention of the tile model.  In this implementation of the 
                        tile model (code by <a href='https://github.com/CodingTrain/Wave-Function-Collapse'>Daniel Shiffman</a>), the computer randomly chooses a tile and places it in the grid. There are "adjacency
                        rules" that determine
                        which tiles can be placed next to the first tile. The second tile is placed in the spot with the smallest number of 
                        possible valid tiles, and so on until all of the spots are filled.
                    </p>

                        <p>
                            "In computing, procedural generation is a method of creating data algorithmically as opposed
                            to manually, typically through a combination of human-generated assets and algorithms
                            coupled with computer-generated randomness and processing power. In computer graphics, it is
                            commonly used to create textures and 3D models. In video games, it is used to automatically
                            create large amounts of content in a game." Source:

                        <p>
                            The essence of the concept of superposition is that all possible states are
                            equally likely. The classic example is a blank sudoku board. Before any numbers are filled
                            in, each spot in the grid can take any of the numbers 1-9.

                        <li>Possibility space</li>
                        <p>
                            The possibility space for each spot on the grid is the list of all possible valid tiles that
                            could be placed there.
                        </p>

                    <div>
                        <li>Lowest possibility state</li>
                        <p>
                            The spot with the fewest possible valid tiles is the one with the lowest possiblity state.
                        </p>

                    <div>
                        <li> Entropy</li>
                        <p>Entropy is a measure of the amount of uncertainty left regarding a spot on the grid. A spot that only had one possible valid tile would have low 
                            entropy and a spot that had many possibilities would have high entropy.
