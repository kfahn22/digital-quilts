# Digital Quilts

## This repository contains p5.js sketches that allow the user to run the wave function collapse algorithm (tile model).  The default colors are black and white, with an option to edit the colors and save the result.  

## The genesis for this project is the WFC Challenge by The Coding Trains Daniel Shiffman.  The WFC collapse code is his, while the tiles and code to add colors, etc is mine.
